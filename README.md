# CUSTOM HCF CORE 

I used to play quite a small in popularity gamemode called "hard-core factions" in minecraft. After finding out the community wasn't active anymore i decided to try make my own plugin and server. 
The server didn't plan out but i did however make good progress on the plugin. If i remember correctly, there was working claims, factions and i learned how to make plugins for servers with spigot.
